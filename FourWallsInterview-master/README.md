# Four Walls Interview
Please fork and send this test back to us. 

## Overview
This is a short refactoring exercise. 

The class FourWallsInterview.Logger violates the Open Close Principle. 

Refactor this class so that message logging types are passed in when constructing FourWallsInterview.Logger, and write a test to ensure FourWallsInterview.Logger.Log is being called with a single string parameter.
## Notes
You don't need to install an IOC package or write code in FourWallsInterview.Program.Main. 

We are just looking to see how you refactor and write tests

Xunit and MOQ have already been installed in the solution. If you have a different preferred mocking or fakes framework, then go ahead and use that :)
